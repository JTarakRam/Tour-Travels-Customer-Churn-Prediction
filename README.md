# Tour-Travels-Customer-Churn-Prediction.
This project is focused on predicting customer churn for a tour and travels company. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company's services. In this case, we want to predict when a customer might stop booking tours with our company.

**Background**<br>
Tour and travels companies depend on customer loyalty for repeat business. If a customer stops using the company's services, it can be costly to acquire a new customer to replace them. By predicting customer churn, a company can take proactive steps to retain customers and prevent them from leaving.<br>

**Approach**<br>
We will use a machine learning algorithm to predict customer churn based on the features in the dataset. The approach will involve the following steps:<br>

+ Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify any patterns or relationships.<br>
+ Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for modeling.<br>
+ Feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.<br>
+ Model selection to choose the best algorithm for predicting churn.<br>
+ Model evaluation to assess the performance of the selected model.<br>
